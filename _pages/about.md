I explore how humans and algorithms are writing the next chapter of organizing together.

My Journey:
* Building theory at [Imperial College Business School](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/business-school/faculty-research/academic-areas/management-entrepreneurship/) as a [PhD researcher](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/xule.lin)
* Grounded my thinking through experiences at University of Notre Dame, University of Chicago, and Ernst & Young
* Now investigating the moment when algorithms step from tools to participants in organizational life

Working Theory of Organizing:
* The nature of organizing transforms as algorithms join decision-making
    * Algorithms shift from tools that augment to agents that participate
    * Current organizational theories struggle to capture this evolution
    * Novel forms emerge from social-technical system interactions
* Understanding requires both depth and breadth
    * Qualitative immersion reveals organizing's lived reality
    * Computational analysis surfaces patterns across contexts
    * This methodological synthesis builds stronger theory
* Timeless principles inform digital futures
    * Core coordination mechanisms transcend technological cycles
    * Shared understanding enables genuine decentralization
    * Traditional wisdom offers lessons for algorithmic age

Working Theory of Human-AI Knowledge Creation:
* Scientific research transforms fundamentally when AI actively shapes knowledge creation
    * AI shifts roles from passive tools to active epistemic collaborators
    * Traditional epistemologies struggle to account for knowledge co-created by humans and algorithms
    * Novel paradigms emerge at the intersections of human cognition, computational methods, and epistemic robustness

Current Investigations:
* Investigating decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) alongside traditional craft practices to reveal common principles of coordination, shared understanding, and governance for decentralized organizing
* Navigating how human-AI collaboration reshapes scientific research
    * Developing innovative qualitative approaches that honor both human agency and algorithmic capabilities
    * Diagnosing the epistemic implications of AI integration in social science research
    * Follow my latest thinking on [Substack - Thread Counts](https://threadcounts.substack.com/)
