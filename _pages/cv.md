# Research Interests

I develop organizational theory for the algorithmic age, examining how organizations coordinate when humans and algorithmic systems jointly determine outcomes. My research asks: What governance mechanisms enable effective functioning? What forms of organizing emerge? Empirically, I investigate: (1) token-based governance in DAOs, identifying mechanisms of token duality, selective centralization, and structured transparency; (2) human-AI collaboration in organizational settings, revealing coordination patterns and emergent organizational capabilities; and (3) traditional craft organizations as historical counterpoints. Methodologically, I pioneer the SIGNA framework: an AI-augmented qualitative approach that preserves interpretive depth while enabling analysis at a computational scale—applicable across organizational and social science research.
