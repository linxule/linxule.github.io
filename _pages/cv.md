# Education

- Imperial College Business School, Imperial College London, 2019 – 2025 (Expected)
	- Doctor of Philosophy, Management and Entrepreneurship
	- Thesis Title: "Rethinking Organizational Design: Token-Enabled Coordination and Governance Adaptation in Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)"
	- Thesis Committee: Erkko Autio, Ying-Ying Hsieh, Kevin Corley, Viviana Fang He (UCL)
- University of Chicago, 2018 – 2019

- University of Notre Dame, 2011 – 2016
	- MSc in Accountancy
	- BBA in Accounting

# Research Interests

I develop organizational theory for the algorithmic age, examining how human judgment and algorithmic systems co-evolve within hybrid governance structures. My empirical research investigates: (1) token-based governance in DAOs, identifying mechanisms of token duality, selective centralization, and structured transparency; (2) human-AI collaboration, revealing recursive agency configurations and emergent epistemic capabilities; and (3) traditional craft organizations as historical counterpoints. Methodologically, I pioneer the SIGNA framework: an AI-augmented qualitative approach that preserves interpretive depth while enabling analysis at a computational scale.

	- Framework for human–AI research collaboration, explaining how human–AI epistemic partnerships transform organizational structure: enabling fewer hierarchical layers, wider spans of control, and a shift from compliance-based management to coherence-based governance.
	- Comprises three interrelated components: Agency Configurations (authority distribution patterns across Directed, Contributory, and Partnership modes), Epistemic Dimensions (six emergent collaborative capabilities along Discovery, Integration, and Projection axes), and Partnership Dynamics (generative forces, balancing tensions, and risks such as epistemic alienation).
	- Provides practical tools: diagnostic frameworks for research teams, organizational design principles for institutional leaders, and nuanced evaluation approaches for policymakers.
