# Research Interests

My research examines organizational design and governance, focusing specifically on decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) and traditional craft organizations, such as bespoke tailoring houses. I'm particularly interested in how these distinct organizational forms innovate and adapt by integrating human judgment with technological capabilities, especially blockchain and artificial intelligence. 

My methodological focus blends qualitative research methods with AI-enhanced inquiry, exploring how intelligent systems shape—and potentially transform—our approaches to theorizing and building knowledge. By actively engaging with academic, industry, and open-source communities, I explore new epistemological boundaries, aiming to develop integrative approaches that enrich both theoretical understanding and practical methodologies in organizational studies.
